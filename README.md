- Values should preferably be **statically typed**. Avoid the use of the `any` type.

## Name etymology
- The name **Fixiversity** is a combination of the words **Fix** and **University**.

- This name was chosen as it represents out mission of *"fixing"* universities that may have problems.

### university (n.)

- *c. 1300*, "institution of **higher learning**," also "body of persons constituting a **university**," from Anglo-French université, Old French universite "universality; academic community" (13c.), from Medieval Latin universitatem (nominative universitas), "the whole, aggregate," in Late Latin "corporation, society," from universus "whole, entire" (see universe). In the academic sense, a shortening of universitas magistrorum et scholarium "community of masters and scholars;" superseded studium as the word for this. The Latin word also is the source of Spanish universidad, German universität, Russian universitetŭ, etc
